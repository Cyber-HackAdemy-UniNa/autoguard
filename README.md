## Solution proposed

Our system primarily provides users with a mobile application and a web interface, allowing them to view their vehicles, associate new ones, and manage them remotely in an intuitive and fast manner. Through the use of the SIEM Chronicle, we ensure proactive security monitoring, enhancing the ability to detect and mitigate potential threats before they can cause significant damage.
