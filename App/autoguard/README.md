## Autoguard

Welcome to Autoguard, a mobile application designed to seamlessly interface with an innovative IoT ecosystem. This project orchestrates communication between the mobile app, a cloud-based virtual machine, and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, creating a robust and user-friendly platform for remote vehicle control.

Key Features:

1. Cloud-Based IoT Environment

The mobile app establishes a secure connection with an IoT environment hosted on a virtual machine in the cloud. This environment serves as the central hub for managing and orchestrating interactions between the app and the Raspberry Pi.

2. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Integration

At the heart of the physical implementation is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, strategically integrated into a scale model of an automobile. The Raspberry Pi acts as the bridge between the cloud-based environment and the vehicle, interpreting commands from the mobile app and executing corresponding actions.

3. Remote Vehicle Control

Users can leverage the mobile app to remotely control various vehicle functionalities:

  Door Control: Effortlessly open and close car doors with a simple tap on the app.
  Headlight Toggle: Toggle the headlights on and off to enhance user convenience and security.

4. MQTT Protocol

To ensure efficient and reliable communication within the entire system, the MQTT protocol is employed. This lightweight and efficient messaging protocol facilitate real-time data exchange between the mobile app, the cloud-based environment, and the Raspberry Pi.

5. User-Friendly Interface

The mobile app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the IoT ecosystem effortlessly. Clear controls and real-time feedback enhance the overall user experience.
